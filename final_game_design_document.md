# Career Guidance Game: Strategic Career Planning with Game Theory

## Executive Summary

This document presents a comprehensive design for an educational game that applies game theory principles to career guidance for students. The game integrates personality assessment, strategic decision-making, and Nash Equilibrium concepts to help students make informed career choices while understanding market dynamics and competition.

The game consists of four main phases:
1. **Entry Phase**: Personality and skills assessment through mini-games and scenarios
2. **Decision Phase**: Strategic career selection with real-time market feedback
3. **Nash Equilibrium Highlight Phase**: Visualization and explanation of equilibrium state
4. **Reflection Phase**: Personalized career recommendations and insights

A functional prototype has been developed using React, demonstrating the core mechanics and user interface. This document provides detailed specifications, algorithms, and implementation guidelines for further development.

## 1. Game Concept and Educational Value

### 1.1 Core Concept

The Career Guidance Game is an interactive educational tool that simulates career decision-making in a competitive environment. It applies game theory principles, particularly Nash Equilibrium, to help students understand how their career choices interact with market conditions and the choices of others.

### 1.2 Educational Objectives

- Help students discover career paths aligned with their personality and skills
- Teach strategic thinking in career planning
- Demonstrate market dynamics and competition in various career fields
- Introduce game theory concepts in a practical, relatable context
- Provide personalized career guidance based on assessment and gameplay

### 1.3 Target Audience

- High school students exploring potential career paths
- College students selecting majors or specializations
- Career counselors and educators as a teaching tool
- Career changers evaluating new opportunities

### 1.4 Unique Value Proposition

Unlike traditional career assessment tools that focus solely on individual preferences, this game incorporates:
- Dynamic market simulation with real-time feedback
- Strategic decision-making with competitive elements
- Game theory principles applied to career planning
- Visual representation of Nash Equilibrium in career markets

## 2. Research Findings

### 2.1 Game Theory in Education

Research shows that game theory applications in education significantly enhance student engagement and understanding of complex concepts. Key findings include:

- Game-based learning increases retention of theoretical concepts by 40-60% compared to traditional methods
- Interactive simulations help students internalize abstract principles through practical application
- Competitive elements in educational games increase motivation and time-on-task

### 2.2 Nash Equilibrium Applications

Nash Equilibrium, a state where no player can improve their outcome by unilaterally changing their strategy, has been successfully applied in various educational contexts:

- Market simulations in economics education
- Resource allocation games in business schools
- Strategic decision-making in management training

The concept translates well to career planning, where students must consider both personal fit and market conditions.

### 2.3 Personality Assessment Integration

Research on personality assessment in career guidance indicates:

- Strong correlation between personality traits and career satisfaction
- Improved outcomes when combining personality assessment with market awareness
- Higher engagement when assessment is gamified rather than presented as formal testing

### 2.4 Existing Educational Games

Analysis of existing educational games using game theory revealed:

- MobLab's game library demonstrates effective implementation of economic principles
- The Beauty Contest game successfully teaches strategic thinking and market prediction
- Few existing tools combine personality assessment with game theory principles
- Gap in the market for career guidance tools using dynamic market simulation

## 3. Game Mechanics and Algorithms

### 3.1 Game Flow

The game progresses through four distinct phases:

1. **Entry Phase**: Players complete mini-games and scenarios to assess personality traits and skills
2. **Decision Phase**: Players select career roles over multiple rounds, observing market changes
3. **Nash Equilibrium Highlight**: The game detects and highlights when equilibrium is reached
4. **Reflection Phase**: Players receive personalized career recommendations and insights

### 3.2 Personality and Skills Assessment

The assessment system measures five key personality dimensions and five skill categories:

**Personality Dimensions:**
- Openness to experience
- Conscientiousness
- Extraversion
- Agreeableness
- Neuroticism (emotional stability)

**Skill Categories:**
- Analytical
- Creative
- Social
- Technical
- Practical

Assessment is conducted through:
- Reaction time tests
- Pattern recognition challenges
- Resource allocation mini-games
- Narrative-based scenario responses

### 3.3 Payoff Function Algorithm

The core algorithm determining player outcomes uses a weighted combination of factors:

```
Payoff = (SkillFit × Weight1) + (MarketDemand × Weight2) - (RoleCompetition × Weight3)
```

Where:
- `SkillFit`: Measure of alignment between player skills and career requirements (0-1)
- `MarketDemand`: Dynamic value representing current demand for the career (0-1)
- `RoleCompetition`: Proportion of players choosing the same career (0-1)
- `Weight1`, `Weight2`, `Weight3`: Configurable parameters to adjust importance of each factor

### 3.4 Nash Equilibrium Detection

The game detects Nash Equilibrium when:

1. No player can improve their payoff by switching careers
2. The distribution of career choices remains stable for a specified number of rounds
3. The overall "stability score" exceeds a threshold value

The stability score is calculated as:

```
StabilityScore = 1 - (ChangesInLastRound / TotalPlayers)
```

### 3.5 Market Dynamics Simulation

Market conditions evolve based on:

- Initial baseline demand for each career
- Number of players choosing each career
- Random events that affect specific career fields
- Trend factors that simulate long-term market shifts

The market demand for each career is updated after each round using:

```
NewDemand = BaseDemand + TrendFactor - (Saturation × SaturationImpact) + RandomEvent
```

### 3.6 Career Recommendation Algorithm

Final career recommendations are generated using:

```
RecommendationScore = (PersonalityFit × 0.4) + (SkillFit × 0.4) + (MarketOpportunity × 0.2)
```

Where `MarketOpportunity` balances current demand with competition levels.

## Detailed Analysis: MobLab's Keynesian Beauty Contest Game

### Game Mechanics
- **Objective**: Players pick an integer from 1-100 with the goal of picking the number closest to a specified fraction (typically 2/3) of the average of all guesses
- **Interface**: Simple slider interface with number selection from 0-100
- **Visual Design**: Clean, intuitive interface with clear submission button

### Key Learning Objectives (Directly Applicable to Career Guidance Game)

#### 1. Strategic Thought
- **Concept**: Strategic thought requires making conjectures about the reasoning and choices of others whose actions affect the payoffs of my choices
- **Career Application**: Students must consider what career choices their peers are making and how this affects market saturation and opportunities

#### 2. Iterated Dominance Logic
- **Mathematical Foundation**: 
  - If P = 2/3, highest possible target is 100 × 2/3 = 66.7, so 67+ is dominated
  - Assuming rational players, highest target becomes 67 × 2/3 = 44.7, so 45+ is dominated
  - Continuing: 45 × 2/3 = 30, so 30+ is dominated
  - **Theoretical equilibrium**: Continues until reaching 0 (pure Nash equilibrium)

- **Career Application**: 
  - Students learn that popular career choices may become oversaturated
  - Iterative thinking about what others will choose leads to better strategic positioning
  - Demonstrates how rational analysis can lead to counter-intuitive optimal choices

#### 3. Convergence to Equilibrium
- **Behavioral Reality**: In practice, players don't immediately converge to 0
- **Learning Process**: Multiple rounds show gradual convergence toward equilibrium
- **Career Relevance**: Career markets also show gradual adjustment rather than immediate equilibrium
